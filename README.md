# Good Seed Supermarket

The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:

  * The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
  * Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo
  * The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age

To start working on the task, you'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.

# Project Process

## Step 1 | Access & Study the data
* Open and skim to become familiar with the data
## Step 2 | Prepare the data
* Convert the data to the necessary types
* Find & Eliminate errors in the data
## Step 3 | Analyze the data
* Conduct EDA & SDA while exercising the 5 analytic frameworks (if applicable):
  * What happened? - Descriptive 
  * Why did it happen? - Diagnostic 
  * What will happen? - Predictive
  * How can we make it happen? - Prescriptive
## Step 4 | Build an Age Detection model 
* Consider and select data that is useful to analyze the ages of various images of people from adult to child that can pinpoint whether or not a customer visiting Good Seed's supermarkets are in fact above the age of alcholic consumption.
## Step 5 | General Conclusion
